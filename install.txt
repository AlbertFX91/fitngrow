Before working with our project, we will need to download the latest dependencies locally.

> Installing Bower
    If we don't have Bower installed in our system, we will use "npm install -g bower".
    That will install the latest version of Bower.

> Updating NodeJS modules
    Execute "npm install" in the root directory of fitngrow project.

> Updating Bower components
    Execute "bower install" in the root directory of fitngrow project.
